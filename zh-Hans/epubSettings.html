            <ul>
                <li><strong>Justify text:</strong> whether you want text to be fully justified while reading.</li>
                <li><strong>Hyphenate text:</strong> whether you want text to be hyphenated while reading.</li>
                <li><strong>Fast theme switching:</strong> enables tapping with two or three fingers anywhere on the page to cycle through your reading color themes (text and paper colors).
                    Two fingers cycle forward, three fingers cycle backward. This is useful if you want to quickly switch themes without opening any menus.</li>
                <li><strong>Multi-color bookmarks:</strong> bookmarks in Marvin are colored red. If you enable this, you’ll be able to
                    create bookmarks with different colors (red, green, or blue). You might use differently colored bookmarks to
                    represent different kinds of annotations.</li>
                <li><strong>Page-turn haptics:</strong> turns on haptic feedback when turning pages. This may affect battery life. Haptics work on iOS 10 or better, and on newer devices such as iPhone 7.</li>
                <li><strong>Scrubber behavior:</strong> set to ‘section’ mode to view your position and scroll within the current chapter or section in the book.
                    Set to ‘book contents’ mode to view your position and scroll across chapters or sections in the table of contents.</li>

                <li><strong>Vertical margin size:</strong> how wide or narrow you want the vertical page margin to be (the <em>horizontal</em> margin size is
                    set in the book’s formatting menu because that’s a per-book setting). On smaller devices such as iPhones, if you set the
                    vertical margin size to <em>small</em> there might not be space to show headers and footers.</li>

                <li><strong>Guide bar on advance:</strong> whether a guide bar is shown to help you track your position when advancing using edge tapping. Only applies when edge tapping is enabled.</li>

                    directory for Marvin to see them.</li>
            </ul>
